# Smart Building ML & DL Classifier

This project applies both **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** algorithms to real-time smart building sensor data to predict motion detection based on various environmental inputs.

## 📁 Dataset

**Filename:** `RealTime_SmartBuilding_Data.xlsx`

This dataset includes features like:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Light Intensity
- Sound Level
- CO₂ Levels
- Motion Detected (Target)

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

### 🔹 Machine Learning Models
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

### 🔹 Deep Learning Model
- Feedforward Neural Network (with Dropout and ReLU activations)

## 🛠 How to Run

### 1. Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras openpyxl
